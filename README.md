# DerbyStats
Shiny App with some Roller Derby Stats

This app shows one of two plots of data from my Roller Derby officiating history:

1.) A bar plot of the frequency I worked each position in a game, and
2.) A bar plot of the frequency with which I worked for each Head Referee.

You can change which plot you see via the radio button, and you can 
change the number of bars on the plot(s) by moving the slider.

There are a maximum of 23 positions, and 44 HRs.
